## Website : Splitwise
### Features
The website created is a web-based clone of the application **Splitwise**. 
1. The website features a Login/Sign-Up page which serves as the home page. The Login option redirects the user directly to the **Dashboard**. The Sign-Up option redirects to a sign-up page where the user has to enter their details. Following this, the user is redirected to the **Dashboard**.
2. The **Dashboard** features two options : **Add an Expense** and **Settle an Expense** which like their namesake are for adding a new expense and settling an old expense with friends respectively.
3. The **Friends** page lists all the friends the user has transactions along with a feature to add more friends and remove existing friends.
