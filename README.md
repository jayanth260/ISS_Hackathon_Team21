## Website : Splitwise
### Features
The website created is a web-based clone of the application **Splitwise**. 
*The website features a Login/Sign-Up page which serves as the home page. Sign-Up redirects to a location to enter details. Following this, the user is redirected to the **DASHBOARD**.
*The **DASHBOARD** features two options : **Add an Expense** and **Settle an Expense** which like their namesake are for adding a new expense and settling an old expense with friends respectively.
*The **Friends** page lists all the friends the user has transactions along with a feature to add more friends and remove existing friends.
*The **Groups** page lists all the groups the user is a part of - formed from the user's friend list.
